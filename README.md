2 - the programm will ask if you have python installed. type "Y" for yes, or "N" for not to answer.
3 - don't close the programm until it closes from itself
4 - you are ready to go! the .exe file is in the frechly created folder called "dist"

1 - run the programm. a Folder called "Locker" should appear in the directory the program is stored in.
